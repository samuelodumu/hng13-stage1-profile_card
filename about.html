                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                  I'm Samuel, a Web developer currently enrolled in the HNG online internship program. I live in Abuja, Nigeria, and I'm passionate
                  about technology, storytelling, and self-improvement. When I'm not
                  studying or coding, you'll probably find me reading a novel, watching
                  a movie, or playing chess. I love exploring new ideas and finding ways
                  to connect my interests to my work in software development.

                <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
                <p>
                  My main goal is to graduate with a strong understanding of frontend engineering and the confidence to build scalable,
                  impactful applications. I want to be consistent in my learning,
                  improve my problem-solving skills, and develop habits that prepare me
                  for a great career in tech. I also hope to network with other
                  driven developers and contribute to meaningful projects before the
                  program ends.
                </p>

                <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
                <p>
                  I sometimes doubt my ability to manage time effectively—especially
                  when balancing studies with personal interests like chess or content
                  creation. I also struggle a bit with staying confident during
                  technical challenges or debugging complex problems. However, I'm
                  learning to embrace discomfort as part of growth.

                <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
                <p>
                  Dear Future Samuel, remember how far you've come and how much effort
                  you put into becoming the person you are now. Keep your curiosity
                  alive, stay humble, and don't lose sight of your values. Progress
                  might not always be linear, but every step—big or small—counts toward
                  your growth.
                </p>

                <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                  I've realized that consistency is more important than motivation.
                  Small efforts, when repeated daily, create lasting change. I want to
                  carry that mindset beyond this program—into my career, relationships,
                  and spiritual life. Also, I hope I never lose my love for learning and
                  creating.
                </p>
